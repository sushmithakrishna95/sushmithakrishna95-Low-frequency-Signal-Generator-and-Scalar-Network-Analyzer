# sushmithakrishna95-Low-frequency-Signal-Generator-and-Scalar-Network-Analyzer
• Built a system using ARM MF4 microcontroller capable of capturing analog signals and generating various waveforms. • Configured UART for command line interface capable of controlling the system and providing measurement data back to the user with use of peripherals such as UART, SPI, SSI, GPIO, Interrupts and IC’s such as MCP4821 DAC, TLV2374, IC 7660 to build the circuit from the schematic drawn in LTSPICE. • Implemented output impedance correction, scalar network analysis, and simple voltmeter operations.
